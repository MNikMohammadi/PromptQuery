# Prompt Query

**Prompt Query** is a simple, interactive console application written in C#. It allows users to repeatedly execute a task based on their input until they choose to exit. The program demonstrates core concepts like loops, user interaction, and conditional logic in a beginner-friendly manner.

## Features

- Interactive prompt for user inputs.
- Support for repetitive execution using a simple `Y/N` choice system.
- Easy-to-understand and maintain console-based design.
- Modular structure for expansion and customization.

## How It Works

1. The program starts and performs a task.
2. At the end of each iteration, the user is prompted:
   - Enter `Y` to run the program again.
   - Enter `N` to exit the program.
3. When the user exits, a message is displayed to indicate the program has ended.
